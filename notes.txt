NOTES:
- created subfunctions for conversions, but some still missing: ft_base and ft_pointer
ALL functions creted but francinette tests failed.
-%p should not work when the second arg is int. mine returns the address, printf
throws error "expected void * but argument is an int". errors still on tests
4 6 7 8 9 
- problems still with %u, %x and %X - none of the tests passed; use ft_test to figure out
why my function always returns 0
